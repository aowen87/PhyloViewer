This is a prototype for a phylogenetic tree viewing application. 
In particular, we are looking for a better way to view data that 
comes from microbiota studies. This data generally consists of a 
series of time samples, each containing the organisms present at
the time the sample was taken. In our viewer, we are aiming to 
create a cylinder of phylogenetic trees from each sample and display
the connections between these samples. 


(As this prototype is under construction, the following guidlines
 are subject to change)

Dependencies:
	-python2.7 (python 3 may work, but it isn't tested)
	-PyOpenGl
	-numpy

Usage: 
	-Within src, you will find phylo_viewer.py
         phylo_viewer runs as follows:

	 python phylo_viewer.py <input_newick_tree> <condensed_counts_file>

	 I have included some sample trees for viewing
	 within the trees directory. You can start 
	 the application by the following command
         within the src directory:

	 python phylo_viewer.py ../trees/full_tree ../data/condensed_counts.txt
